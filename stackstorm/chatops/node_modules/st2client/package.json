  "readme": "StackStorm ST2 JavaScript bindings [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]\n==============================================================================\n\nOfficially supported node.js\\browserify client library for using ST2 APIs.\n\nThe library (and the whole API, to be fair) is in **Alpha**, so incompatible changes should be expected.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe library is distributed through the npm. To install it, run:\n\n    npm install st2client\n\n## Usage\n\nDepending on the environment, you need to either require it (node\\browserify)\n\n    var api = require('st2client')();\n\nor add a script tag to the head of your `index.html` and access it through the global variable\n\n    <script src=\"node_modules/st2client/dist/st2client.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      ...\n      var api = st2client(config);\n      ...\n    </script>\n\nIn both cases, `st2client` is a factory that takes `config` object as an argument and returns an `api` object with a number of entities (`actions`, `actionExecutions`, `rules`, ...) each having a set of methods (`list()`, `get()`, `create()`, ...). Method returns an A+ compliant promise or throws an error if it can't make a request due to insufficient data (i.e. `id` in `api.actions.get(id)` is undefined).\n\n## Documentation\n\n[![IRC](https://img.shields.io/irc/%23stackstorm.png)](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=stackstorm)\n\nPlease refer to [StackStorm Docs](http://docs.stackstorm.com).\n\n## Hacking\n\nTo build it manually, clone the project, install dependencies and then run `gulp`\n\n    npm install -g gulp\n    npm install\n    gulp\n\nYou can also launch gulp in a watch state so it would lint and recompile browserify version every time it will detect the change.\n\nIntegration tests require `st2` to be present. To set up dev environment and run StackStorm, follow [these instructions](http://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html).\n\n### Running Unit Tests\n\n```bash\ngulp test\n```\n\n### Running Browser tests\n\n```bash\ngulp test-browser\n```\n\n### Running Integration tests\n\nFor the integration tests to work, all the StackStorm services including\nauthentication service need to be running and accessible to the client.\n\nThe client assume you are using Vagrant setup so it will try to connect to\nauth service running on ``172.168.60.10`` using username ``testu`` and password\n``testp``.\n\nUsername and password used for authentication can be configured in\n``integration/config.js``.\n\n```bash\ngulp test-integration\n```\n\n## Copyright, License, and Contributors Agreement\n\nCopyright 2014 StackStorm, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this work except in compliance with the License.
