You can invite your bot to any channel just as a regular user. It listens and perform your commands. The adapter uses [mattermost-client](https://github.com/loafoe/mattermost-client) for all low level Mattermost communication.\n\n## Try the Hubot demo\n\nYou can try out Hubot by joining the Mattermost community server and joining the Hubot channel: \n\n1. [Create an account](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/signup_user_complete/?id=f1924a8db44ff3bb41c96424cdc20676) on the Mattermost nightly builds server at https://pre-release.mattermost.com/\n2. Join the \"Hubot\" channel\n3. Type `hubot help` for instructions\n\n### Sample commands\n\nYou can try a simple command like `hubot the rules` to bring some static text stored in Hubot: \n\n![s](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177788/20645776/b25da69a-b41c-11e6-81d2-a40d76947e60.png)\n\nTry `hubot animate me` to have Hubot reach out to Giphy and bring back a random animated image.\n\n![s](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177788/20645764/88c267a8-b41c-11e6-96c9-529c3ca844f3.png)\n\nTry `hubot map me [NAME_OF_CITY]` to have Hubot reach out to Google Maps and bring back a map based on the name of a city you pass in as a parameter. For example, `hubot map me palo alto` brings back the below map of Palo Alto\n\n![s](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/177788/20645769/9d58a786-b41c-11e6-90b1-6a9e7ab19172.png)\n\n## Docker usage\n\n### Standalone\n\nClone this repository, then build the Hubot-Matteruser container:\n\n```\ndocker build --build-arg hubot_owner=<owner> \\\n             --build-arg hubot_name=<name> \\\n             --build-arg hubot_description=<desc> \\\n             --tag=hubot-matteruser \\\n             .\n```\n\nStart the container:\n\n```\ndocker run -it \\\n           --env MATTERMOST_HOST=<mm_host> \\\n           --env MATTERMOST_GROUP=<mm_team> \\\n           --env MATTERMOST_USER=<mm_user_email> \\\n           --env MATTERMOST_PASSWORD=<mm_user_password> \\\n           -p 8080:8080 \\\n           --name hubot-matteruser \\\n           hubot-matteruser\n```\n\n### Docker Compose\n\nTo integrate with a running Mattermost instance, update docker-compose.yml accordingly and launch the bot:\n\n``` \ndocker-compose build\ndocker-compose run -d\n```\n\n\nIf you just want to test locally, you can find [here](https://github.com/banzo/mattermost-docker/tree/feature/hubot-matteruser) a fork of the [official Mattermost Docker Compose stack](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker) plugged to Hubot-Matteruser: \n\n\n## Installation\n\n### 1) Install a Mattermost server\n\nFollow the [Mattermost install guides](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/administrator.html#install-guides) to set up the latest version of Mattermost 3.6.x.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Make sure your `hubot-matteruser` and `mattermost-client` versions **match** the major version of your Mattermost server so the API versions will match. \n\nFor example, if you're using Mattermost server version 3.6.0 or 3.6.1, the _major version_ is \"3.6\", and you need version 3.5 of `hubot-matteruser` and `mattermost-client`. Neither version 3.5 or 3.7 will work, since the Mattermost server doesn't yet support API deprecation. See [releases archive](https://github.com/loafoe/hubot-matteruser/releases) for older versions. \n\n### 2) Install hubot-matteruser\n\nOn a separate server, install `hubot-matteruser` using the following commands: \n\n  ```sh\nnpm install -g yo generator-hubot\nyo hubot --adapter matteruser\n  ```\n\nFollow the instructions to set up your bot, including setup of [`mattermost-client`](https://github.com/loafoe/mattermost-client). \n\n#### Environment variables\n\nThe adapter requires the following environment variables to be defined before your Hubot instance will start:\n\n| Variable | Required | Description |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| MATTERMOST\\_HOST | Yes | The Mattermost host e.g. _mm.yourcompany.com_ |\n| MATTERMOST\\_GROUP | Yes | The team/group on your Mattermost server e.g. _core_ |\n| MATTERMOST\\_USER | Yes | The Mattermost user account name e.g. _hubot@yourcompany.com_ |\n| MATTERMOST\\_PASSWORD | Yes | The password of the user e.g. _s3cr3tP@ssw0rd!_ |\n| MATTERMOST\\_WSS\\_PORT | No | Overrides the default port `443` for  websocket (`wss://`) connections |\n| MATTERMOST\\_HTTP\\_PORT | No | Overrides the default port (`80` or `443`) for `http://` or `https://` connections |\n| MATTERMOST\\_TLS\\_VERIFY | No | (default: true) set to 'false' to allow connections when certs can not be verified (ex: self-signed, internal CA, ... - MITM risks) |\n| MATTERMOST\\_USE\\_TLS | No | (default: true) set to 'false' to switch to http/ws protocols |\n| MATTERMOST\\_LOG\\_LEVEL | No | (default: info) set log level (also: debug, ...) |\n| MATTERMOST\\_REPLY | No | (default: true) set to 'false' to stop posting `reply` responses as comments |\n\n#### Example configuration\n\nThe below example assumes you have created a user `hubot@yourcompany.com` with username `hubot` and password `s3cr3tP@ssw0rd!` on your Mattermost server in the `core` team reachable on URL `https://mm.yourcompany.com/core`\n\n  ```sh\nexport MATTERMOST_HOST=mm.yourcompany.com \nexport MATTERMOST_GROUP=core\nexport MATTERMOST_USER=hubot@yourcompany.com\nexport MATTERMOST_PASSWORD=s3cr3tP@ssw0rd!\n  ```\n\n## Upgrade\n\nTo upgrade your Hubot for Mattermost 3.6, find the `package.json` file in your Hubot directory and look for the line in the `dependencies` section that references `hubot-matteruser`. Change the verion so it points to `^3.6.0` of the client. Example:\n\n  ```json\n    ...\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"hubot-matteruser\": \"^3.6.0\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ```\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Make sure your `hubot-matteruser` and `mattermost-client` versions **match** the major version of your Mattermost server so the API versions will match. \n\nFor example, if you're using Mattermost server version 3.6.0 or 3.6.1, the _major version_ is \"3.6\", and you need version 3.6 of `hubot-matteruser` and `mattermost-client`. Neither version 3.5 or 3.7 will work, since the Mattermost server doesn't yet support API deprecation.
